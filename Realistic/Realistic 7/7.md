## 🧠 Step-by-Step Approach

Step 1: Visit the Website

This indicates that the page retrieves files dynamically through the `file=` parameter, suggesting that the website uses a directory named **`/images`**.

Step 3: Explore the `/images` Directory
By accessing or probing the `/images` directory, we discover that:

- The directory **exists**
- It contains additional folders, including a crucial one: **`/admin`**

This hidden directory is part of the mission and leads to the protected section of the website.
