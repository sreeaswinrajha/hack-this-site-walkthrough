## ðŸ§  Approach

1. **Understanding the Web Page**  
   The attacker replaced the main page with a new `index.html`. However, the original page was not deletedâ€”it was renamed to `oldindex.html`.

3. **Viewing `oldindex.html`**  
   By accessing `oldindex.html`, we can see the original login page still exists.

5. **Uploading a New Page**  
   There was a file upload feature (for uploading music). We can exploit this by creating a new file called `../index.php` and uploading it.
