# ðŸ›  Challenge Description

Network Security Sam is going down with the ship - he's determined to keep obscuring the password file, no matter how many times people manage to recover it. This time the file is saved in 
/var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/9/. 
In the last level, however, in my attempt to limit people to using server side includes to display the directory listing to level 8 only, I have mistakenly screwed up somewhere.. there is 
a way to get the obscured level 9 password. See if you can figure out how..

#  Goal

To locate the file containing the password, we must leverage Server Side Includes (SSI) for directory traversal, as standard path navigation is restricted.
