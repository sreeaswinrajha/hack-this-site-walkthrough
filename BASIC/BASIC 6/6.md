</br> so we will verfy the output to understand it

</br> it convert it to asky and add 1 in each asky value

##  Example

| Original | ASCII | +1 | Encrypted |
|----------|-------|----|-----------|
| `a`      | 97    | 98 | `b`       |
| `b`      | 98    | 99 | `c`       |
| `c`      | 99    |100 | `d`       |

**Input:** `abc`  
**Encrypted Output:** `bcd`

</br> By using asky table we can guess and create the descryption key
