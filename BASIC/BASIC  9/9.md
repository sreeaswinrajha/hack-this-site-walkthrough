# ðŸ›  Challenge Description

Network Security Sam is going down with the ship - he's determined to keep obscuring the password file, no matter how many times people manage to recover it. 
This time the file is saved in /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/9/.In the last level, however, in my attempt to limit people to using server side 
includes to display the directory listing to level 8 only, I have mistakenly screwed up somewhere.. there is a way to get the obscured level 9 password.
See if you can figure out how...
 ___
#  Goal
Exploit a misconfiguration in Server Side Includes (SSI) meant for level 8 to access the hidden password file for level 9, bypassing direct access restrictions.
Leverage SSI injection to traverse directories and reveal sensitive content on the server.
